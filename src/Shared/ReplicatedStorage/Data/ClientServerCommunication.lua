	Registers a state replication action. This adds it to the list of actions that can be replicated and sets up the
	handler function that will be called when the action is replicated to this context.

	---

	This function is available on both the client and server. The context of where this function is called determines
	whether the action is registered in that context only. For replication to work, the action must be registered in
	both contexts. (Requests will queue if necessary.)

	An action can only be registered once per context. Attempting to register an action again will fail.

	On the client, this function will yield until the action is registered on the server.

	On the server, you can assume that the player's persistent data is loaded when the handler is called. (This is
	because the inverse should never happen; and if it somehow does, the handler will not be called.)

	---

	@param name The name of the action to register. This is the name that will be used when replicating the action.
	@param handler The function that will be called when the action is replicated.
