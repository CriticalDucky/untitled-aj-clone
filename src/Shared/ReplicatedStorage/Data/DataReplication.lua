	---

	`action` is the name of the action to replicate.

	`data` is the data to replicate with the action. This can be any replicatable value.

	`player` is the client to replicate to, when called from the server. It is **required** on the server and
	**ignored** on the client.

	The given action must be registered for it to replicate. If it is not, this function will yield until it is. See

--[[
	Registers a state replication action. This adds it to the list of actions that can be replicated and sets up the
	handler function that will be called when the action is replicated to this context.

	---

	`name` is the name of the action to register. This is the name that will be used when replicating the action.

	`handler` is the function that will be called when the action is replicated. On the server, the first parameter is
	the player that replicated the action, while the second parameter is the action data. On the client, the first and
	only parameter is the action data. This parameter may be ommitted if the action will only be used to replicate to
	the opposite context.

	This function is available on both the client and server. The context of where this function is called determines
	whether the action is registered in that context only. For replication to work, the action must be registered in
	both contexts. (Requests will queue if necessary.)

	An action can only be registered once per context. Attempting to register an action again will fail.

	On the client, this function will yield until the action is registered on the server.

	When registering an action on the server with a handler, the provided handler should ensure that the given data is
	valid. If it is not, it should not accept the request and instead send a replication request back to the client
	with the current data to resync.

	On the server, you can assume that the player's persistent data is loaded when the handler is called. (This is
	because the inverse should never happen; and if it somehow does, the handler will automatically be ignored.)
